# VISUAL STUDIO .NET
Visual Studio .NET is a complete set of development tools for building ASP Web applications, XML Web services, desktop applications, and mobile applications In addition to building high-performing desktop applications, you can use Visual Studio's powerful component-based development tools and other technologies to simplify team-based design, development, and deployment of Enterprise solutions.
         
Visual Basic .NET, Visual C++ .NET, and Visual C# .NET all use the same integrated development environment (IDE), which allows them to share tools and facilitates in the creation of mixed-language solutions. In addition, these languages leverage the functionality of the .NET Framework and simplify the development of ASP Web applications and XML Web services.
      	
Visual Studio supports the .NET Framework, which provides a common language runtime and unified programming classes; ASP.NET uses these components to create ASP Web applications and XML Web services. Also it includes MSDN Library, which contains all the documentation for these development tools.

# ASP.NET	
ASP.NET is a web application framework developed and marketed by Microsoft to allow programmers to build dynamic web sites, web applications and web services.
It was first released in January 2002 with version 1.0 of the .NET Framework, and is the successor to Microsoft's Active Server Pages (ASP) technology.
